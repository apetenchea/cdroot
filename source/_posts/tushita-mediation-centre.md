## Introduction

Tushita is a centre for the study and practice of Buddhism (Mahayana Tradition). I was eyeing this place for a while,
with a deep sense of curiosity and a desire to learn more about meditation. I initially heard about them before through their
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkMRZy1T2IuyP5jS0Uy_jeA). Eventually, I had the opportunity to attend
one of their courses, "Introduction to Buddhism", which left such a big impression on me that I decided to stay for a
second one, "Transforming the Mind: The 7-Point Mind Training".

### Location

The centre is located in McLeod Ganj, Dharamshala, India. The name literally translates to "Place of Joy", which can
definitely be the case if you're into meditation. At the foothills of the Himalayas, it is surrounded by forests
and monkeys, while still being easily accessible from McLeod Ganj. Mind you, the whole area is quite hilly, so be prepared
for a little exercise if you're looking to get there on foot. On clear days you can see the snow-capped mountains in the
distance, and the sunsets are just breathtaking - they have **amazing sunsets** at Tushita (and around the area).
Perhaps it's the "no phones" policy which makes you appreciate the beauty of nature even more.

Culturally, the whole area is a mix of Indian and Tibetan influences, with a lot of monks and nuns walking around. The
Dalai Lama's temple is close by in Dharamshala. Just near Tushita, there's a Goenka Vipassana centre, whose gong you'll
definitely hear in the morning. There are lots of shops and restaurants around, geared towards both Indian and foreign
tourists. Most probably you'll find something to your liking.

The main gompa (meditation/lecture hall) can hold a bit over 100 people, and it's quite cozy. Their sound system is
pretty good, and the acoustics are great. Apart from that, there a libray and several other meditation places around the
centre.

There's plenty of space to stroll around, with benches and tables scattered around the area. There's also a main stupa,
which you may find interesting to walk around.

### Registration

For registration, I followed the instructions on [their website](https://tushita.info/). It was pretty basic, I just had
to complete a form and got my confirmation by email in a few days. Needless to say, you'll need an Indian visa if you're
coming from abroad. During the peak season (June to October), it's a good idea to book in advance, as the courses fill up
quickly. Don't place your hopes on a last-minute registration, as you might be disappointed. Even if you happen to show
up, and you're lucky enough to get a spot, you'll still need to go through the registration process, so might as well do
it online. Note that they have a "no phones" policy, so make sure to leave your phone (or other gadgets) at the reception
when you arrive - you'll get it back at the end of the course. Trust me, it's a good thing.

### Transport

My plane arrived in Delhi. From there, you have a couple of options to get to McLeod Ganj: by bus, train or plane. I
have experienced the train (going) and the plane (getting back).

#### Train

I booked a hotel in Paharganj, which is close to the New Delhi Railway Station, so going to the station was no big deal.
If you plan on taking the train, make sure to leave enough time to get to the station, as the traffic in Delhi can be
quite heavy. I took the _Malwa Express_ to Pathankot, and from there I took a (per-booked) taxi to McLeod Ganj. The train
ride was quite an experience, but it took a long time (around 10 hours) and arrived with a 3-hour delay. The taxi ride
was another 3 hours, so I arrived in McLeod Ganj quite tired. The train was comfortable though, not too crowded, and I
managed to get a tiny bit of sleep.

#### Plane

The closest airport to McLeod Ganj is Kangra-Gaggal Airport (Dharamshala). I boarded a plane from Dharamshala to Delhi,
operated by IndiGo. This took about 1 hour, and it was pretty much hassle-free. A 15-minute delay due to air traffic
in Delhi, but that was it. This option is definitely more expensive than the train, but it's faster and more comfortable.
If I were to go again, I'd probably choose the plane.

### Accommodation

The accommodation you'll be able to get at Tushita is pretty basic (they'll even joke at the reception that
"it's not the beach of Goa"). It varies from dormitories to single rooms, and elderly people get priority for the
single rooms (for obvious reasons), then everybody else gets to choose an options, according the order of registration
(first come, first served). Both times, I stayed in the big dormitory (6-8 people), which was fine for me. There is
hot water available for the showers (through a boiler), and some of the toilets are western-style. Overall, you'll find
the place surprisingly clean and well maintained.

You might want to bring a sleeping bag with you - I was glad I had mine, as it can get quite cold at night. Bear in mind
that you'll be staying up in the Himalayas, not in the plains of India. You might be able to rent an additional blanket
at the reception, but don't count on that.  
The food is vegetarian (more geared towards vegan). Expect nothing fancy - you'll get three meals per day, where you can have
as much as you want. Their peanut butter tastes very good, but make sure not to overdo it (can be tempting) - it's made from
blended peanuts mixed with vegetable oil and salt. Combined with bread, it can be a heavy combo.  
Note that they only provide accommodation for the duration of the course, so if you plan on staying longer, you'll need to find
another place. It is not possible to stay as a tourist at Tushita, and they are quite strict about this.
