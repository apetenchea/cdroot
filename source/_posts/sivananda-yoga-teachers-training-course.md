## Background

Back when I first started, my yoga practice was a bit clumsy, but I never truly felt like starting from zero.
During my childhood, I always had a good relationship with sports.
I was part of the local [junior rugby team](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apetenchea/cdroot/master/source/_posts/sivandanda-yoga-teachers-training-course/media/rugby.jpg).
During the long summer vacations, I used to play sports every day with my friends. Our go-to place used to be the
[basketball field](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apetenchea/cdroot/master/source/_posts/sivandanda-yoga-teachers-training-course/media/basketball.jpg).
I really enjoyed playing team sports. As time passed, we all got into college, family life and work. It became harder and harder to synchronize
a group of people that would be willing to play sports together. That's when I shifted my focus to individual sports,
where generally the only person you need to synchronize with is yourself. Gym was the obvious choice, but in a way it felt
superficial. The moves were repetitive and the environment was not inspiring. I am not saying
that going to the gym is bad. I still attend fitness classes and train in a gym regularly.
It's just that, for me, this feels like a great complement to other sports, but it's a means to an end, not my main focus.   
However, when I tried yoga, I was finally able to find an activity that I could practice on my own, but still feel like
I am part of a community. It allows me to better connect with myself.  
I started by watching online videos. When my practice got serious, I started attending yoga classes.
That progressed into taking private lessons. Fast-forward a few years later, and I have now enrolled into a
teacher's training course. I am joining an ashram in Southern India, for a month-long intensive course.
