## Introduction

### Background

Back when I first started, my yoga practice was a bit clumsy, but I never truly felt like starting from zero.
During my childhood, I always had a good relationship with sports.
I was part of the local [junior rugby team](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apetenchea/cdroot/master/source/_posts/sivandanda-yoga-teachers-training-course/media/rugby.jpg).
During the long summer vacations, I used to play sports every day with my friends. Our go-to place used to be the
[basketball field](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apetenchea/cdroot/master/source/_posts/sivandanda-yoga-teachers-training-course/media/basketball.jpg).
I really enjoyed playing team sports. As time passed, we all got into college, family life and work. It became harder and harder to synchronize
a group of people that would be willing to play sports together. That's when I shifted my focus to individual sports,
where generally the only person you need to synchronize with is yourself. Gym was the obvious choice, but in a way it felt
superficial. The moves were repetitive and the environment was not inspiring. I am not saying
that going to the gym is bad. I still attend fitness classes and train in a gym regularly.
It's just that, for me, this feels like a great complement to other sports, but it's a means to an end, not my main focus.   
However, when I tried yoga, I was finally able to find an activity that I could practice on my own, but still feel like
I am part of a community. It allows me to better connect with myself.  
I started by watching online videos. When my practice got serious, I started attending yoga classes.
That progressed into taking private lessons. Fast-forward a few years later, and I have now enrolled into a
teacher's training course. I am joining an ashram in Southern India, for a month-long intensive course.  

### Purpose of writing this

I decided to document this experience, as I believe it will be a great way to reflect on my journey and to share it
with others. This is not a guide on how to become a yoga teacher, nor advice on how to prepare for an intensive course.
Every person is different, and there's plenty of approaches to yoga. I am just sharing my own experience.

> Make sure to only compare yourself to your past self.


### Course

The course is organized by the [SIVANANDA YOGA VEDANTA TAPASWINI ASHRAM](https://sivananda.org.in/gudur/), located in
Gudur, Andhra Pradesh. The dates are 17th Dec 2023 - 13th Jan 2024. I picked the ashram in Gudur because it had
specific dates that worked for me, taking into account my job and other commitments.

I found out about this school from the [Neyyar Dam Sivananda](https://www.youtube.com/@SivanandaDhanwantariAshram) and
[Sivananda Yoga Centre, Gurgaon](https://www.youtube.com/@SivanandaYogaCentreGurgaon) YouTube channels.
I was looking for a school with a traditional approach to yoga and their content resonated well with me.
There are plenty of Sivananda centers around the world, but I wanted one located in India, as I sought the opportunity
to experience the culture and the country.  
The course I'm taking is a 200h Teachersâ€™ Training Course (TTC), based on the ancient [gurukula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurukula)
system of India where teacher and student live together in a traditional Ashram. Graduates receive an internationally
recognized certificate. The school is a member of the [Yoga Alliance](https://www.yogaalliance.org/).

### Preparation

Generally, I believe the best way to prepare for something is to do it. So of course, I've been practicing yoga regularly
at home and in classes. To aid with the physical aspect of it, I'm doing some fitness training at [D' Point Studio](https://dpointstudio.ro/).
The classes are great and the instructors are very knowledgeable. Every week, I attend three private training sessions,
and aim for two group classes (one full body workout and a core workout). To get a glimpse of
what it looks like, check out their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@dpointstudio).

<hr>

**Monday**  
8:00 - 9:00 personal training (<abbr title="High Intensity Interval Training">HIIT</abbr>)  
I find HIIT the hardest of my workouts. In the beginning, it was very difficult to keep up with the pace, but now I really
enjoy it. It is indeed a challenge to keep my breath steady during the most intense parts of the workout, and it has
helped me a lot in that regard. I believe doing this type of athletic training once a week is a good way to balance
out the more relaxed pace of yoga, as I like to experience this kind of exercise as well, from time to time.  

**Tuesday**  
Yoga, at home. I generally use this day to recuperate from the previous day's workout.

**Wednesday**
8:00 - 9:00 personal training (suspended training)  
With yoga, you do a lot of pushing exercises, but not so many pulling ones, and on Wednesdays I try to balance that out.
It's also a great way to build strength in your core and back muscles. Pull-ups are the main part of this workout. The
progress is generally slow, but steady, and you have to keep doing it regularly to maintain the results.

**Thursday**  
18:30 - 19:30 fitness class (Power Strength - full body workout)  
This is where I get to sweat a lot. It's a good way to build strength and stamina, while making sure that not muscle
group is left behind. Generally, my legs are most sore after this workout.

**Friday**  
8:00 - 9:00 personal training (workout)  
A bit more random, depending on how I felt during the week and what me and my trainer decide to focus on. 
Usually, we try to fine-tune some of the exercises. If I feel there's a muscle group that needs more attention, my trainer
would come up with suitable exercises to target that area. Or, if I don't make it to the group class on Thursday, we might do a
leg workout.

**Saturday**  
11:15 - 12:00 fitness class (Core Strength - core workout)  
I can't stress enough the importance of core muscles in yoga, and in life in general. For me, the abs require the most
maintenance. I find it very easy to lose the results I've gained, if I don't exercise regularly. This is a difficult class,
but it comes with soo many benefits.

**Sunday**  
Yoga, at home. By now, I've had plenty of fitness during the week, so I try not to overdo it.

<hr>

Looking at the above, it might seem like a lot, but I've been doing this for a while now, so my body is used to it.   
Sometimes, I might skip a workout, if I feel like I could use some extra rest. However, I never skip my personal training
sessions. I find that having a personal trainer is a great way to keep myself accountable and show up. Needless
to say, in order to maintain this lifestyle, the sleeping schedule (and eating habits) have to be on point. I generally aim to be in
bed before 22:00.  
You might be wondering where is the yoga in all of this. **Well, I try to do yoga every day, but I don't have a fixed schedule.**
What kind of practice I do really depends on how I feel. Sometimes, I might do a full one-hour class, other times
I might just do a short meditation. There's plenty of practices to choose from, but usually my main focus is on
hip-opening and balance poses.

### Visa

I got my indian visa from [indianvisaonline.gov.in](https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/). I heard there are some websites
out there which try to pose as the official one, so be careful.

### Schedule

In the last couple of months before the course, I became more serious with my preparation. I decided to record my daily
schedule, which I'll share below. I tried to keep it as consistent as possible, but sometimes I had to make adjustments
to accommodate other commitments. Nevertheless, recording my schedule was a great way to keep myself on track. I'm
not saying that this is the best way to prepare for a yoga course. Bear in mind I had zero prior experience with yoga
courses, so I'm just sharing my own practice.
